## Course Content

### Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression

### Advanced Learning Algorithms
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

### Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
